A place to store books

This project is part of The Odin Project. It involves creating book objects that are then displayed on the screen with their name, author, and number of pages. 

It contains an add button that allows the user to add books to their shelf and stores them in local memory. It connects to google books api and has a dynamic book search bar that allows the user to select the book they are looking for, then displays the selected book's thumbnail, title, and author.

The things I had to learn to complete this project are: 

- How to connect to an API 
- how to use the fetch function in JS
-What a promise is
- How to implement a debounce on the search bar so as not to repeatedly fetch to the api while the user is typing
-How to access local storage to save and access memory.
-What JSON is
-What Function.prototype.bind() is
-How to create a modal
-How to create a tooltip
